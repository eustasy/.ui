Open, accessible, customizable web components written as vanilla as possible.

### Languages
- HTML, CSS, absolutely minimal JavaScript.
- Use only vanilla, modern, and widely-supported elements across all languages.

### Considerations
- Nuclearity: Do one thing well, and very little else.
- Customization: Themeable colors, borders, and spacing should persist across all elements. Make frequent use of CSS variables. Dropping a component onto a page should just work.
- Accessibility: All components should play well with accessibility add-ons such as screen-readers, navigating with a keyboard instead of a mouse, or using voice commands. [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) should be taken as a general standard.
